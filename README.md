# Face_recognition_project

# Overview
This project implements a real-time face recognition system using computer vision techniques. The system can detect and recognize human faces from images or video streams, making it applicable to security systems, user authentication, and other scenarios involving facial identification.

# Features
Face Detection: Uses Haar cascades or other algorithms to detect faces in real-time from webcam or image inputs.
Face Recognition: Identifies recognized faces using pre-trained machine learning models.
Data Collection: Captures face data from webcam and stores it for training the recognition model.
Training: Trains a classifier using collected face data for accurate face identification.
Real-Time Recognition: Continuously processes frames from the webcam and identifies known faces.

# Technologies Used
OpenCV: For face detection and image processing.
Python: Main programming language used to implement the project.
Haar Cascade Classifier: For efficient face detection.

# How It Works
The system detects faces using Haar cascades in each frame of the video stream.
Detected faces are compared against the trained face recognition model to identify known faces.
The system displays the name of the recognized individual, or "Unknown" if the face is not recognized.

# Use Cases
Security and surveillance systems
User authentication for applications
Personalized user experiences based on face identification

# Future Enhancements
Integrate with deep learning models for improved accuracy.
Add support for recognizing multiple faces simultaneously.
Implement facial expression analysis for enhanced user insights.
